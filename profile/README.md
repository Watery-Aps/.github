## About

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Watery Aps – Tech Department**.

We are a highly aligned, cross-functional, innovation-driven technology powerhouse dedicated to building scalable, resilient, and occasionally working systems.

This is where serious engineering happens.

Mostly.

---

## Our Core Competencies

- Turning coffee into production incidents  
- Deploying on Fridays (strategically)  
- Writing "temporary" fixes that live forever  
- Renaming variables instead of solving the problem  
- Saying “it works on my machine” with confidence  

---

## Engineering Philosophy

We believe in:

- Clean code (we will clean it later)
- Scalable architecture (after version 1.7.3-hotfix-final-final)
- Strong documentation (README coming soon)
- Automation (we have a script somewhere)
- Zero downtime (unless you refresh)

---

## Repository Overview

You may find repositories such as:

- `core-services` – The heart of the system. Do not touch.
- `frontend` – 47 shades of “almost aligned”.
- `infrastructure` – Terraform applied with bravery.
- `tooling` – Tools that fix tools that fix tools.
- `experiments` – Where good ideas go to become legacy systems.

---

## Deployment Strategy

1. Ship it.
2. Observe.
3. Panic.
4. Patch.
5. Call it iterative improvement.

---

## Code Standards

All code must:

- Compile (ideally)
- Pass tests (locally)
- Contain at least one comment explaining why it should not exist
- Avoid being blamed in standups

---

## Security

We take security very seriously.

Please do not:

- Expose secrets
- Hardcode API keys
- Paste production credentials into Slack again

If you discover a vulnerability, congratulations. You now own it.

---

## Monitoring & Reliability

Our systems are monitored 24/7 by:

- Alerts
- Logs
- Hope
- The one person who gets paged
